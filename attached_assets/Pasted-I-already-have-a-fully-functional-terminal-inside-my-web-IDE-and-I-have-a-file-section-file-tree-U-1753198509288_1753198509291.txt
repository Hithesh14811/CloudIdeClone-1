I already have a fully functional terminal inside my web IDE, and I have a file section (file tree UI) where all user files and folders are displayed.
Now, I want you to connect the terminal and the file section, so that any changes made by terminal commands (like npx create-react-app, mkdir, touch, etc.) are reflected live in the file tree, exactly like how VS Code does it.

Do this without changing the design of the terminal or file section UI.

🎯 Your Goal:
Whenever a terminal command creates, deletes, or modifies files/folders:

The file tree UI should update live

No page reload or manual refresh should be required

🛠️ How to Implement It:
✅ 1. Use chokidar to Watch File System in Backend
Set up a file watcher in Node.js using chokidar

Watch the user’s project folder (e.g., /user-projects/{user_id})

On any file/folder change (create, delete, rename, update):

Rebuild the file tree as a nested JSON structure

Send this updated structure via WebSocket to the frontend

Use this example watcher:

js
Copy
Edit
const chokidar = require('chokidar')
const fs = require('fs')
const path = require('path')

function buildTree(dir) {
  const stats = fs.statSync(dir)
  if (!stats.isDirectory()) return null

  const tree = { name: path.basename(dir), type: 'folder', children: [] }
  const files = fs.readdirSync(dir)

  for (let file of files) {
    const filePath = path.join(dir, file)
    const stat = fs.statSync(filePath)

    if (stat.isDirectory()) {
      const subtree = buildTree(filePath)
      if (subtree) tree.children.push(subtree)
    } else {
      tree.children.push({ name: file, type: 'file' })
    }
  }

  return tree
}
Emit updates over WebSocket:

js
Copy
Edit
watcher.on('all', () => {
  const tree = buildTree(projectPath)
  ws.send(JSON.stringify({ type: 'file-tree-update', tree }))
})
✅ 2. Hook the Watcher into the Terminal WebSocket Session
In your WebSocket connection handler (used for the terminal), call the file watcher function and pass the active ws (WebSocket instance).

This ensures that the same terminal session is responsible for updating the file tree.

✅ 3. Handle Updates on the Frontend
In the frontend WebSocket message handler:

If message.type === 'file-tree-update', call a function like renderFileTree(message.tree)

This function should update the file section UI to match the current directory structure

Example:

js
Copy
Edit
socket.onmessage = (e) => {
  const message = JSON.parse(e.data)
  if (message.type === 'file-tree-update') {
    renderFileTree(message.tree)
  } else {
    terminal.write(e.data)
  }
}
✅ 4. Keep It Modular
Don’t touch the terminal UI code

Don’t touch the file tree UI layout/design

Just wire together the backend events and frontend updates properly

✨ Expected Final Behavior:
User types npx create-react-app my-app in the terminal

Thousands of files and folders are created by the script

The backend detects all changes via chokidar

A new nested file structure is sent to the frontend

The frontend updates the file tree section to show my-app/ and all its content in real time

Works just like VS Code’s terminal and explorer integration
