Step 1: Real-time File Tree Updates (Your Issue #1)
Problem Analysis
From your description and the implementation notes in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md:

You already implemented file watching with chokidar and auto-refresh every 500ms in the backend. This means the server detects changes fast.

Frontend still does not reflect changes instantly. This is caused by:

Frontend depends on polling (every 500ms) instead of using real-time events.

Socket.IO integration exists (setupTerminalSocket, files:forceRefresh event), but file update events aren’t emitted for every change.

Deletion UX lag (2–3 sec delay) happens because UI waits for React Query to re-fetch data instead of applying optimistic updates immediately.

node_modules visibility is disabled or partially ignored. So CRA’s progressive creation isn’t shown fully.

Production-Grade Fix
1. Replace polling with true real-time sync via Socket.IO

Backend already has setupTerminalSocket(io) and a FileSync service.

In fileSync.ts (not shown fully but referenced), after every file system event, emit:

ts
Copy
Edit
io.to(projectId).emit('files:updated', { projectId, eventType, filePath });
Subscribe frontend FileExplorer component to this event:

ts
Copy
Edit
useEffect(() => {
  socket.on('files:updated', ({ projectId }) => {
    queryClient.invalidateQueries(['files', projectId]);
  });
  return () => socket.off('files:updated');
}, [projectId]);
Result: Instant updates as soon as the backend sees the change, no polling.

**2. Implement Optimistic Updates for Deletions

In deleteFile mutation:

ts
Copy
Edit
mutationFn: async (fileId) => { await api.delete(`/api/files/${fileId}`); },
onMutate: async (fileId) => {
  await queryClient.cancelQueries(['files', projectId]);
  const prevFiles = queryClient.getQueryData(['files', projectId]);
  queryClient.setQueryData(['files', projectId], (old) =>
    old.filter((f) => f.id !== fileId)
  );
  return { prevFiles };
},
onError: (_err, _id, context) => {
  queryClient.setQueryData(['files', projectId], context.prevFiles);
},
This removes files instantly on click, without waiting for API.

3. Show Progressive File Creation During create-react-app

Remove ignore filter for node_modules in chokidar config only for top-level folder creation.

Backend:

ts
Copy
Edit
chokidar.watch(workspaceDir, {
  ignored: ['**/node_modules/**'], // Keep deep ignores
  depth: 10,
  ignoreInitial: true
})
This will show folders as they appear (like VS Code).

4. Fix Database Sync Bottleneck

Currently, file tree is DB-backed. After every FS change, you do DB sync + query invalidation.

For progressive UX, render UI from in-memory FS state first, then update DB in background:

When chokidar detects a new file, emit socket event immediately.

In background, update DB.

Frontend updates instantly from event → no visible delay.

✅ End Result after this fix:

File tree updates instantly during create-react-app (shows new folder in < 200ms).

Deletions remove immediately without waiting 2–3 sec.

No manual refresh required.

Matches VS Code-like behavior.
