Problem Breakdown
❌ 1. Delayed appearance of deleted files
Even after deletion, the UI update takes time (~2s) before reflecting.

❌ 2. Bulk terminal file generation appears only after command finishes
You run create-react-app my-app.

Only after the entire setup is done, the folder and files appear in one go.

VS Code shows folder creation as it happens (e.g., node_modules, src/, package.json, etc., in real time).

✅ Real Solution: Live file watching (not just manual refresh)
To fix both issues, your system must:

🛠 1. Watch file system changes on the server using chokidar
So it emits every small file/folder creation event.

🛠 2. Send live updates to the frontend via WebSocket immediately when files/folders are added/deleted
🧩 Fix for Slowness (Recommended Implementation)
✅ Backend Changes:
🔧 Step 1: Install chokidar to watch the file system
bash
Copy
Edit
npm install chokidar
🔧 Step 2: Setup file watcher in backend (e.g., watcher.ts)
ts
Copy
Edit
import chokidar from 'chokidar';
import path from 'path';
import { Server } from 'socket.io';

export function watchProjectDir(io: Server, projectPath: string, projectId: string) {
  const watcher = chokidar.watch(projectPath, {
    ignoreInitial: true,
    depth: 10,
  });

  watcher
    .on('add', () => io.to(projectId).emit('file-tree-update', { projectId }))
    .on('addDir', () => io.to(projectId).emit('file-tree-update', { projectId }))
    .on('unlink', () => io.to(projectId).emit('file-tree-update', { projectId }))
    .on('unlinkDir', () => io.to(projectId).emit('file-tree-update', { projectId }));
}
Then in your server boot or terminal execution handler:

ts
Copy
Edit
watchProjectDir(io, fullProjectPath, projectId);
Now, any change—even inside npx create-react-app—will emit a live event the moment files are added.

✅ Frontend Changes (minimal)
You're already listening to:

ts
Copy
Edit
socket.on("file-tree-update", ...)
So no changes needed if the socket emits for every add/unlink now.

✅ Fix for Deletion Delay
The current ~2 second delay likely comes from:

Calling deleteManyFiles (which is a loop of deletes or a slow FS op).

Waiting for the query to invalidate.

Then re-rendering the list.

Instead, optimistically update the UI and let the server handle the rest:

✨ In your delete mutation:
ts
Copy
Edit
onMutate: async (deletedPaths) => {
  queryClient.setQueryData(['project-files', projectId], (old: FileItem[]) => {
    return old.filter(item => !deletedPaths.includes(item.path));
  });
},
This makes the UI remove the files instantly, then confirms it later when onSuccess happens.

🧠 Why Create-React-App delays all files
Because CRA generates all files in memory or temp, then writes them in bulk at the end. So your server only sees them after everything completes.

That’s why chokidar is critical here—it picks up new file events as they're written, even if CRA does them in bursts.

✅ Final Summary
Problem	Fix
Files update only after full create-react-app finishes	Use chokidar to watch file changes and emit updates via socket live
Deletion appears slow	Optimistically update frontend state before waiting for mutation response
No progressive folder updates	Use watcher to emit socket updates on every file add/delete
