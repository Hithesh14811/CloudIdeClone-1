Your IDE successfully creates the app folder and package.json in real time but node_modules never appears because of two main reasons:

1. CRA’s post-install hook is failing
The terminal is running inside node-pty (pseudo-terminal) on a temporary workspace directory (/tmp/shetty-workspace/...).

But node_modules is not being installed because:

The environment might not allow full npm install to run (e.g., missing Node/npm in PATH or container).

CRA uses npx create-react-app → which internally runs npm install after scaffolding.

If npm fails or is killed early, node_modules will never be generated.

2. Your File Sync intentionally ignores deep node_modules
Even if CRA successfully creates node_modules, your chokidar watcher excludes it by default:

ts
Copy
Edit
ignored: ['**/node_modules/**']
This was done for performance reasons (to avoid syncing thousands of files).

Result: node_modules is created on disk, but your database + UI never sees it.

✅ Detailed Production-Grade Fix
We need a solution that:

✅ Allows CRA to install node_modules successfully.

✅ Shows the node_modules folder in file tree (but does NOT crash UI due to thousands of files).

✅ Maintains proper parent-child folder structure (like VS Code).

✅ Avoids performance bottlenecks.

Step 1: Ensure CRA can install dependencies
Confirm your backend executes commands inside a real shell environment with Node/npm available:

In setupTerminalSocket() (from server/sockets/terminal.ts), verify:

ts
Copy
Edit
const shell = process.env.SHELL || '/bin/bash';
const ptyProcess = pty.spawn(shell, [], {
  name: 'xterm-color',
  cwd: workspaceDir,
  env: process.env
});
✅ Ensure env includes:

PATH to Node.js and npm binaries.

NODE_ENV=development (or as required).

If running in a container, install Node.js & npm.

Test by running:

bash
Copy
Edit
which node && which npm
inside the terminal.

Step 2: Show node_modules (but avoid syncing all files)
Goal: Display the root node_modules folder and basic status like VS Code, but don’t load thousands of files in DB/UI.

Update chokidar watcher in fileSync.ts:

ts
Copy
Edit
chokidar.watch(workspaceDir, {
  ignored: ['**/node_modules/**', '!node_modules'], // ignore deep subfolders
  depth: 2, // show node_modules as a folder only
  ignoreInitial: false,
  persistent: true
});
This:

Tracks node_modules folder itself.

Does NOT track thousands of files inside.

✅ After this, when CRA finishes, you’ll see:

kotlin
Copy
Edit
app/
  node_modules/   (as a single folder)
  package.json
  public/
  src/
Step 3: Maintain Parent-Child Hierarchy in DB
Your DB uses a parentId column but during sync you might be flattening everything.

Update file sync logic:

When a folder/file is added:

Find its parent path → query DB → get parent ID.

Insert with correct parentId.

Example:

ts
Copy
Edit
async function syncFile(path: string) {
  const parentPath = path.dirname(path);
  const parent = await storage.findByPath(projectId, parentPath);
  await storage.createOrUpdateFile({
    name: path.basename(path),
    path,
    isFolder: fs.lstatSync(path).isDirectory(),
    parentId: parent?.id || null,
    projectId
  });
}
✅ This guarantees:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
app/
  public/
    index.html
  src/
    App.js
Step 4: Prevent UI Crash with Lazy Loading
When user expands node_modules, load contents only when clicked:

ts
Copy
Edit
const [expanded, setExpanded] = useState(false);
const handleExpand = async () => {
  setExpanded(!expanded);
  if (!expanded) {
    await queryClient.fetchQuery(['files', nodeModuleFolderId]);
  }
};
This keeps the initial load fast.

✅ After these fixes:
CRA installs node_modules successfully.

You see:

java
Copy
Edit
app/
  node_modules/
  public/
  src/
  package.json
UI is responsive (no heavy load).

Database preserves correct parent-child relationships.
