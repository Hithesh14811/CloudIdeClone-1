Your recent fix partially worked but created two major new problems:

Progressive updates incomplete:

app folder and package.json appear immediately, but src, public, and other subfolders do not show progressively.

This is because your file sync service is still using a debounced DB update model while the UI relies on DB as the source of truth.

Chokidar detects changes, but emitFileUpdate() only fires after DB sync → deep nested folder creation is batched, not emitted in real time.

Duplicate files after refresh:

When you refresh the browser, every sync run re-inserts files into DB instead of upserting, so the same file path gets multiple DB rows.

This happens because storage.createFile() does not check if the file path already exists before inserting.
In server/storage.ts:

async createFile(file: InsertFile): Promise<File> {
  const [newFile] = await db.insert(files).values(file).returning();
  return newFile;
}
→ No uniqueness check.

node_modules missing:

You intentionally excluded it in chokidar config for performance, but VS Code shows it immediately because it’s part of FS.

If you want a real VS Code experience, you must at least show the root node_modules folder without traversing its contents.

✅ Production-Grade Fix Plan
1. Fix Progressive Updates
Instead of wait → sync DB → update UI, emit UI updates directly from FS events:

watcher.on('add', (filePath) => {
  io.to(projectRoom).emit('files:updated', { event: 'add', path: filePath });
  scheduleDbSync(filePath); // async, non-blocking
});
UI applies the update instantly from socket event, then revalidates from API later.

2. Enforce File Uniqueness in DB
Add unique constraint in DB migration:


ALTER TABLE files ADD CONSTRAINT unique_project_path UNIQUE (project_id, path);
Change createFile to upsert:


async createOrUpdateFile(file: InsertFile): Promise<File> {
  const [result] = await db
    .insert(files)
    .values(file)
    .onConflictDoUpdate({
      target: [files.projectId, files.path],
      set: { updatedAt: new Date(), content: file.content }
    })
    .returning();
  return result;
}
Replace all createFile() calls in sync logic with this new method.

3. Show node_modules root but skip deep traversal
Adjust chokidar:


chokidar.watch(workspaceDir, {
  ignored: ['**/node_modules/**', '!node_modules'], // ignore subfolders only
  depth: 2, // show node_modules but not its internals
  ignoreInitial: true
});
In frontend, apply lazy loading for large folders (expand on click).

4. Eliminate Ghost/Duplicated Folders in UI
Problem: React Query merges stale data with new → duplicates if API returns duplicates.

Fix: Backend guarantees unique data (see #2).

Additionally, in React Query:


select: (data) => {
  const seen = new Set();
  return data.filter((f) => {
    if (seen.has(f.path)) return false;
    seen.add(f.path);
    return true;
  });
}
5. Optimize File Sync for CRA-like Experience
Current sync is debounced 500ms.

Use two-stage sync:

Stage 1: Emit socket immediately for UI → instant appearance.

Stage 2: DB sync in background with deduplication.

✅ Final Architecture After Fix
Socket-first updates → Instant UI feedback.

DB as eventual consistency layer → Safe state after refresh.

No duplicates → Unique index + upsert logic.

node_modules partially visible for realism without killing performance.

Optimistic UI for deletions & moves.
